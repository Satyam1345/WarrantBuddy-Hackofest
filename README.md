This repository contains the source code for a Digital Warrant Management System developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The platform aims to revolutionize the legal process by introducing digital tracking and verification systems, providing comprehensive legal assistance, and empowering individuals with accessible resources.

## Key Features

### Digital Tracking and Verification
- *Warrant Tracking*: Introduces a digital tracking system for arrest warrants, allowing individuals to verify warrant authenticity and prevent hoaxes.
- *Accelerated Process*: Streamlines legal processes, making them faster and more efficient.
- *Environmental Sustainability*: Reduces paper usage and contributes to environmental sustainability by digitizing warrant tracking.

### Transparency and Accountability
- *Record Keeping*: Records the time and location of successful arrests and executed search warrants to ensure transparency in law enforcement operations.
- *Prevention of Fraud*: Prevents fake arrests, fraudulent searches, and enhances accountability within the justice system.
- *Geo-Tagging*: Geo-tags the location of arrests, providing verifiable data for legal proceedings.

### User Empowerment
- *Family Notification*: Enables family members to verify arrest warrants using OTP, enhancing user empowerment and trust in the system.
- *Reporting System*: Provides a platform for reporting arrests made without warrants, empowering individuals in asserting their rights and holding law enforcement accountable.

### Comprehensive Legal Assistance
- *AI Chatbot*: Introduces an AI chatbot to provide instant access to legal knowledge and insights into constitutional information.
- *Educational Resources*: Offers valuable educational resources alongside tracking and verification features, enhancing user understanding of legal processes.

### Accessible Legal Representation
